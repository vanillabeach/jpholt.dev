# JPHOLT.DEV

This is the source code for my [résumé website](https://jpholt.dev). If you are a UX or Front End engineer, you might find it useful to better understand how I architect and write code. Please feel free to reach out to me at [john@jpholt.dev](mailto:john@jpholt.dev).

### Tech Stack:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) : Type safe language that compiles to JavaScript
- [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) : Component-based framework that renders to DOM
- [Three](https://threejs.org/) : WebGL based 3D rendering framework
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) : CSS Styling Library (limited mostly to text rendering)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) : Compiles all of the above into a minified web app
